# Welcome to the Simple Linear-Regression Readme!

Simple Linear Regression Model is also called as Linear Regression Model or Regression or LM Model or Linear Model. Whats is Regression? Ans.Regression is nothing but the Prediction.

For Applying SLR,

Data Type must be Numeric or Continuous.
There should be One dependent variable and One independent variable
The Linear relation between two variables which is a relation between dependent and independent variable.

Note: In SLR the model can have only one dependent variable and one independent variable.

### SLR can be defined as,

Y = α + β(x)


Where ,
Y -> Dependent Variable  
α -> Constant  
β -> Coefficient  
x -> Independent Variable  

So here,  
The variable Y is dependent on independent variable x.  
Both variable must be Numeric & Continuous
